# UniversalSpeechToText

## problem 
Did you know that the average person speaks at 130 words per minute? Furthermore, the average person 
types at just 40 words per minute. Imagine how much time people could save if they just typed with their voice!

## solution
Due the efficency described above, I made UniversalSpeechToText. Basically, you can turn on the program, and when you talk, it types it in the active text box. 

## technical stuff
The program was developed in Python. Google's speech recognition AI model was used to compile
the audio in to text, via the speech_recognition library. The keyboard library was used to do the acutal typing.
